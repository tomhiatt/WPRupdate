abstract = {The routine tuberculosis (TB) surveillance system in Cambodia has been strengthened under the National TB Programme (NTP). This paper provides an overview of the TB surveillance data for Cambodia at the national level for the period 2000 to 2013 and at the subnational level for 2013. The proportion of the total population that were screened for TB rose from 0.4{\%} in 2001 to 1.1{\%} in 2013, while the smear-positivity rate decreased from 28.9{\%} to 8.1{\%} in the same period. The total number of notified TB cases increased steadily from 2000; this has stabilized in recent years with 39 055 cases notified in 2013. The proportion of all TB cases that were smear-positive decreased from 78{\%} in 2000 to 36{\%} in 2013. Case notification rates (CNRs) for all forms of TB and new smear-positive TB in 2013 were 261 and 94 per 100 000 population, respectively. Higher CNRs were found in the north-west and south-east parts of the country and were higher for males especially in older age groups. The increase in TB screening, decline in the smear-positive rate and decline in notified smear-positive TB cases likely reflect a long-term positive impact of the NTP. A negative correlation between the proportion of the population screened and the smear-positivity rate at the subnational level helped identify where to find undiagnosed cases. Subnational differences in case notification of the elderly and in children provide more specific targets for case-finding and further encourage strategic resource allocation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore whether lower tuberculosis notification rates among women are due to a reduced access to health care, particularly diagnostic services, for women. METHODS Age- and sex-specific tuberculosis prevalence rates of smear-positive tuberculosis were obtained from tuberculosis prevalence surveys reported to the WHO or published in the literature. Age- and sex-specific notification rates from the same countries in 1996 were used. RESULTS Prevalence data and notifications from 29 surveys in 14 countries were used. Notification rates varied strongly among countries, but the female/male ratio was below 1 and decreased with increasing age in almost all. The female/male (F/M) prevalence ratios were less than 0.5 in surveys in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Region, and approximately 1 in the African Region. CONCLUSION In most countries the F/M sex ratio in prevalent cases was similar or lower than that in notified cases, suggesting that F/M differences in notification rates may be largely due to epidemiological differences and not to differential access to health care. However, available data are limited as the prevalence surveys in Africa were carried out many years ago, and in Asia notification rates may be distorted by a large private sector with deficiencies in notification.},

Gender aspects of TB have been neglected in the research, and little attention is given to gender in TB-control programs. This review brings together the most important publications on gender and TB during 1999 and 2000 and illuminates areas where gender has an impact on the disease and its control. Even though only a limited number of publications on gender aspects of TB are available, some interesting findings were presented during the past year. Studies from Vietnam have shown that women with pulmonary TB are diagnosed on average 2 weeks later than men because of delays from the health care provider. In a study of persons with cough it was found that men were given sputum examinations more often than women. These and other findings are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that women with TB are under-notified.},

TB incidence is falling in most settings worldwide, but the rate of decline is far lower than expected. There is growing evidence from national TB prevalence surveys and other research of a large pool of undetected TB in the community. Intensified efforts to further break down access barriers and scale up new and rapid diagnostic tools are likely to improve the situation. However, will these be enough? Or do we also need to reach out more towards people who do not actively seek care with well-recognisable TB symptoms? There have recently been calls to revisit TB screening, particularly in high-risk groups. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends screening for TB in people with human immunodeficiency virus infection and in close TB contacts. Should other risk groups also be screened systematically? Could mass, community-wide screening, which the WHO has discouraged over the past four decades, be of benefit in some situations? If so, what screening tools and approaches should be used? The WHO is in the process of seeking answers to these questions and developing guidelines on systematic screening for active TB. In this article, we present the rationale, definitions and key considerations underpinning this process.},

abstract = {China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30{\%} of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80{\%} of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets. At the same time, specific efforts to improve tuberculosis control also contributed to strengthening of the public-health system. We examine how the strengthening of a disease control programme and the public-health system worked together to achieve a desired health outcome. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of Tuberculosis: Guidelines, adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines. Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new edition.First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) will reduce the number of relapses and failures. This will alleviate patient suffering resulting from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and programme resources.Second, this fourth edition confirms prior WHO recommendations for drug susceptibility testing (DST) at the start of therapy for all previously treated patients. Finding and treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in previously treated patients will help to improve the very poor outcomes in these patients. New recommendations for the prompt detection and appropriate treatment of (MDR-TB) cases will also improve access to life-saving care.Third, detecting MDR-TB will require expansion of DST capacity within the context of country-specific, comprehensive plans for laboratory strengthening. This fourth edition provides guidance for treatment approaches in the light of advances in laboratory technology and the country's progress in building laboratory capacity.Fourth, diagnosing MDR-TB cases among previously treated patients and providing effective treatment will greatly help in halting the spread of MDR-TB. This edition also addresses the prevention of acquired MDR-TB, especially among new TB patients who already have isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis when they start treatment.Finally, this edition strongly reaffirms prior recommendations for supervised treatment, as well as the use of fixed-dose combinations of anti-TB drugs and patient kits as further measures for preventing the acquisition of drug resistance.},

Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

Despite these successes, TB control programmes in the Region face significant challenges, such as hard-to-reach vulnerable and marginalized groups, in which the TB epidemic tends to concentrate, TB-HIV co-infection and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB, especially multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). To mitigate these threats, the Regional Strategy to Stop Tuberculosis in the Western Pacific (2011-2015) was developed in consultation with and endorsed by Member States. The new Strategy builds upon the previous two regional strategic plans and introduces new, evidence-based interventions and technologies in response to the new and emerging challenges. The Strategy provides a reference for action to be taken, focusing on five core objectives: (1) Promoting universal and equitable access to quality TB diagnosis and treatment for all people; (2) Strengthening TB laboratory capacity; (3) Scaling up the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB; (4) Expanding TB/HIV collaborative activities; and (5) Strengthening TB programme management capacity.},

It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic and progress in implementing and financing TB prevention, care and control at global, regional and country levels using data reported by over 200 countries that account for over 99{\%} of the world's TB cases. The report is accompanied by a special supplement that marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Project on Anti-TB Drug Resistance Surveillance. The supplement highlights the latest status of knowledge about the epidemic of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the programmatic response. The report has 9 main chapters. The introductory chapter provides general background on TB as well as an explanation of current global targets for TB control, the WHO's Stop TB Strategy that covers the period 2006-2015 and the post-2015 global TB strategy that was recently endorsed by all Member States at the 2014 World Health Assembly. The remaining eight chapters cover the disease burden caused by TB (incidence, prevalence, mortality); a special assessment ("countdown to 2015) of progress towards 2015 global TB targets at global, regional and country level; TB case notifications and treatment outcomes; drug resistance surveillance among TB patients and the programmatic response in detecting and providing treatment for multidrug-resistant TB; diagnostics and laboratory strengthening for TB; addressing the co-epidemics of TB and HIV; financing TB care and control; and research and development for new TB diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The three annexes of the report include an explanation of how to access and use the online global TB database, one-page profiles for 22 high TB-burden countries and one page regional profiles for WHO's six regions.},

abstract = {TB control in the Western Pacific Region has seen substantial progress in the last decade with a 33{\%} reduction in prevalent TB cases since 2000. The burden remains immense however, and national TB programmes must evolve and adapt in order to build upon these gains. Through routine surveillance, countries and areas in the Region reported 1.4 million TB cases in 2012. The case notification rate increased in the early 2000s and in recent years appears to have stabilized and is in decline for all forms and new smear-positive cases respectively. The age and sex breakdown for smear-positive TB case rates by country shows generally higher rates with increased age and declining rates over time for all age groups. Treatment success remains high in the region with 15 countries across the region reaching or maintaining 85{\%}. HIV testing among TB patients has increased gradually along with a slow decline in the number of HIV-positive patients found. The trend of TB notification is heavily influenced by programmatic improvements in many countries and rapidly changing demographics. It appears that cases are being found earlier as reflected in declining rates of smear-positive TB with steady rates of TB in all forms. WHO estimates depict a decline in TB incidence in the Region. HIV testing, while still low, has increased substantially in recent years with essential TB/HIV services expanding in many countries. TB surveillance data, within inherent limitations, is an important source of programmatic and epidemiological information. Careful interpretation of these findings can provide useful insight for programmatic decision making.},

abstract = {SETTING: Six provinces in Vietnam where the DOTS strategy was introduced in 1989. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of improved tuberculosis (TB) control on TB epidemiology in Vietnam. METHODS: Data from the surveillance system in the period 1990-2003 were analysed to assess trends of notification rates and the mean ages of notified cases. Data from repeated tuberculin surveys in the period 1986-2002 were estimated to assess the prevalence of TB infection, the annual risk of infection and its trend using various cut-off points in those with and without bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scar. RESULTS: Age-standardised notification rates in the period 1996-2003 declined significantly, by 2.6{\%} to 5.9{\%} per year, in five provinces. However, in four provinces notification rates in the age group 15-24 years increased significantly, by 4.5{\%} to 13.6{\%} per year, during this period. The mean age of newly diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB increased up to 1995 but decreased thereafter. The annual risk of TB infection showed a significant annual decrease (4.9{\%} per year) in one province in surveys performed between 1986 and 1997, and in two provinces (6.6{\%} and 4.7{\%}) in surveys conducted between 1993 and 2002.
